# Scope

Remember when mousse was the only option for curly hair? We've come a long way since then, thankfully, with a bountiful explosion of products for every hair type and texture but which product to use? Smoothing creams? Texturizers? the options are endless and the process is intimidating. The good news is that the curl types are a good blueprint for figuring out your routine and products to use.

This project aim to build a multi class image classifier that will detect the types of curl based on an image and recommend a set of product based on the curl type detected by the model.


# Methodology

Data: Images scrapped from google images for 9 categories of curl types:

- Wavy hair : Type 2a, 2b, 2c
- Curly hair: Type 3a, 3b, 3c
- Kinky hair: Type 4a, 4b, 4c

Algorithm: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) 


# Target

Predict the 9 classes( Type 2a, Type 2b, Type 2c, Type 3a, Type 3b, Type 3c, Type 4a, Type 4b, Type 4c)
